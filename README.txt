These is the source code of the "app" build with the nodebeginner book.

The progress of the "app" is captured by several commits. Added own 
comments which might not always be correct as they are my own interpretation.

For more resources about the book: http://www.nodebeginner.org

Buy the book at http://leanpub.com/nodebeginner
or purchase together with "hands on node" at http://leanbundle.com/p/nodebeginner
